  <h2>CHAPTER I - THE ONE THING NEEDFUL</h2>

  <p>'NOW, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing
  but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and
  root out everything else. You can only form the minds of reasoning
  animals upon Facts: nothing else will ever be of any service to
  them. This is the principle on which I bring up my own children, and
  this is the principle on which I bring up these children. Stick to
  Facts, sir!'</p>

  <p>The scene was a plain, bare, monotonous vault of a school-room,
  and the speaker's square forefinger emphasized his observations by
  underscoring every sentence with a line on the schoolmaster's
  sleeve. The emphasis was helped by the speaker's square wall of a
  forehead, which had his eyebrows for its base, while his eyes found
  commodious cellarage in two dark caves, overshadowed by the
  wall. The emphasis was helped by the speaker's mouth, which was
  wide, thin, and hard set. The emphasis was helped by the speaker's
  voice, which was inflexible, dry, and dictatorial. The emphasis was
  helped by the speaker's hair, which bristled on the skirts of his
  bald head, a plantation of firs to keep the wind from its shining
  surface, all covered with knobs, like the crust of a plum pie, as if
  the head had scarcely warehouse-room for the hard facts stored
  inside. The speaker's obstinate carriage, square coat, square legs,
  square shoulders, - nay, his very neckcloth, trained to take him by
  the throat with an unaccommodating grasp, like a stubborn fact, as
  it was, - all helped the emphasis.</p>

  <p.'In this life, we want nothing but Facts, sir; nothing but
  Facts!'</p>

  <p>The speaker, and the schoolmaster, and the third grown person
  present, all backed a little, and swept with their eyes the inclined
  plane of little vessels then and there arranged in order, ready to
  have imperial gallons of facts poured into them until they were full
  to the brim.</p>


  <h2>CHAPTER II - MURDERING THE INNOCENTS</h2>

  <p>THOMAS GRADGRIND, sir. A man of realities. A man of facts and
  calculations. A man who proceeds upon the principle that two and two
  are four, and nothing over, and who is not to be talked into
  allowing for anything over. Thomas Gradgrind, sir - peremptorily
  Thomas - Thomas Gradgrind. With a rule and a pair of scales, and the
  multiplication table always in his pocket, sir, ready to weigh and
  measure any parcel of human nature, and tell you exactly what it
  comes to. It is a mere question of figures, a case of simple
  arithmetic. You might hope to get some other nonsensical belief into
  the head of George Gradgrind, or Augustus Gradgrind, or John
  Gradgrind, or Joseph Gradgrind (all supposititious, non-existent
  persons), but into the head of Thomas Gradgrind - no, sir!</p>

  <p>In such terms Mr. Gradgrind always mentally introduced himself,
  whether to his private circle of acquaintance, or to the public in
  general. In such terms, no doubt, substituting the words 'boys and
  girls,' for 'sir,' Thomas Gradgrind now presented Thomas Gradgrind
  to the little pitchers before him, who were to be filled so full of
  facts.</p>

  <p>Indeed, as he eagerly sparkled at them from the cellarage before
  mentioned, he seemed a kind of cannon loaded to the muzzle with
  facts, and prepared to blow them clean out of the regions of
  childhood at one discharge. He seemed a galvanizing apparatus, too,
  charged with a grim mechanical substitute for the tender young
  imaginations that were to be stormed away.</p>

  <p>'Girl number twenty,' said Mr. Gradgrind, squarely pointing with
  his square forefinger, 'I don't know that girl. Who is that
  girl?'</p>

  <p>'Sissy Jupe, sir,' explained number twenty, blushing, standing
  up, and curtseying.</p>

  <p>'Sissy is not a name,' said Mr. Gradgrind. 'Don't call yourself
  Sissy. Call yourself Cecilia.'</p>

  <p>'It's father as calls me Sissy, sir,' returned the young girl in
  a trembling voice, and with another curtsey.</p>

  <p>'Then he has no business to do it,' said Mr. Gradgrind. 'Tell him
  he mustn't. Cecilia Jupe. Let me see. What is your father?'</p>

  <p>'He belongs to the horse-riding, if you please, sir.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Gradgrind frowned, and waved off the objectionable calling
  with his hand.</p>

  <p>'We don't want to know anything about that, here. You mustn't
  tell us about that, here. Your father breaks horses, don't he?'</p>

  <p>'If you please, sir, when they can get any to break, they do
  break horses in the ring, sir.'</p>

  <p>'You mustn't tell us about the ring, here. Very well,
  then. Describe your father as a horsebreaker. He doctors sick
  horses, I dare say?'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes, sir.'</p>

  <p>'Very well, then. He is a veterinary surgeon, a farrier, and
  horsebreaker. Give me your definition of a horse.'</p>

  <p>(Sissy Jupe thrown into the greatest alarm by this demand.)</p>

  <p>'Girl number twenty unable to define a horse!' said
  Mr. Gradgrind, for the general behoof of all the little
  pitchers. 'Girl number twenty possessed of no facts, in reference to
  one of the commonest of animals! Some boy's definition of a
  horse. Bitzer, yours.'</p>
